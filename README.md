# Car Parking API

## Context

There's a car park at the Manchester Airport.

This car park has 10 spaces available so only 10 cars can be parked at the same time. Customers should be able to park a car for a given period (for example 10 days).

## Task
Create a simple API which allows users to make a booking for given dates, manage capacity (number of free spaces) and option to check if there's a car parking space available.

- Customer should be able to check if there's an available car parking space for given dates.
- Customer should be able to check parking price for given dates (for example summer prices might be different from winter prices)
- Customers should be able to create a booking for given dates (from - to)
- Customers should be able to cancel given booking
- Customers should be able to amend given booking


## Solution

A simple API built using Symfony with 5 endpoints (detailed in the Postman Collection below).
